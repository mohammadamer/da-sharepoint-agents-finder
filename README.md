# SharePoint Agents Finder declarative agent

## Summary

SharePoint Agents Finder uses the Microsoft Graph API as a Copilot plugin in a declarative agent, leveraging the Microsoft Graph Search API /search/query endpoint to retrieve information about SharePoint Agents and event any file in Microsoft 365. It helps end users or IT Admins get info about SharePoint Agents in SharePoint or find files in Microsoft 365 using Graph API Search!
